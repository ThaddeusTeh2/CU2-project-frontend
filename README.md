TODO

-map the data from the api to the views

-create states and functions to change those states, pass the changed states to the backend to update db

-session implementation so that the site knows who we are

-go back and shove the auth middleware into the controllers so i dont get hacked live

-back to the frontend to do some if-else statements to make sure users are not supposed to see admin shi,
