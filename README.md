# React + Vite

TODO

we're basically done with CRUD for dash, multi level user auth start

-make login and signup work by making it able to req res data frm backend

-session implementation so that the site knows who we are

-go back and shove the auth middleware into the controllers so i dont get hacked live

-back to the frontend to do some if-else statements to make sure users are not supposed to see admin shi,

-go back and patch editDialog states not updating upon Section update ex. (if you update mazda to mazda(brand) to toyota(brand), change is not reflected upon editing miata (car) )

finally make the website responsive
